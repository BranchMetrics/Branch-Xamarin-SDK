This folder contains the nuspec file for building the nuget package for
the Branch Xamarin SDK.

To create the nuget package, first start Xamarin Studio and do a complete 
Release build of the project.  Then update the .nuspec file with the 
appropriate version string.  Finally, build the nuget package with the
following command:

nuget pack Branch-Xamarain-SDK.nuspec -BasePath ./

(The -BasePath ./ is necessary due to a bug in the Mac version of the
 nuget command.)

You should now have a nuget package in this folder with the new version
string.  The file should be roughly 77k in size.  If it is significantly
smaller, something went wrong with the build.

It is ok if you see a warning "Invalid framework folder" reguarding
Xamarin.iOS10.  The package is still generated correctly.
